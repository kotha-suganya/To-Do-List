These three Python projects are simple beginner-friendly programs that help practice core concepts of programming. The Rock Paper Scissors project is a small game where the user plays against the computer, which makes random choices, and the program decides the winner or if itâ€™s a tie, repeating until the user quits. The Calculator project allows users to enter two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /) to get results, with error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero, and it keeps running until the user types quit. The To-Do List project is a command-line task manager where users can add, view, and remove tasks, with each task stored in a list, and the program continues until quit is entered. Together, these projects demonstrate the use of loops, conditionals, lists, error handling, and user input in Python, making them excellent practice for beginners.
